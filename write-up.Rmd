# Full Model

For $i=1,\ldots,n$ observations, denote each observation's group of scores as $\textbf{Y}_i$, where
$$
\textbf{Y}_{i} = \left( \begin{array}{c}
Y_{i,1}\\
Y_{i,2}\\
Y_{i,3}\\
\end{array} \right) 
= \left( \begin{array}{c}
\text{political participation score}\\
\text{political satisfaction score}\\
\text{economic satisfaction score}\\
\end{array} \right)
$$
The full model is in the form of

$$\textbf{Y}_i \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \Sigma \sim MVN(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \Sigma).$$ 
$$\boldsymbol{\theta} \sim MVN(\boldsymbol{\mu}_0, \Lambda_0)$$
$$ \Sigma \sim \text{inverseWishart}(\nu_o, S_o^{-1}).$$

Let $\boldsymbol{\theta} = ({\theta}_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)$ denote the mean scores for 1) political participation, 2) political satisfaction, and 3) economic satisfaction.

Let $\Sigma$ denote the covariance matrix, where the $(i,j)^{\text{th}}$
component of $\Sigma$ is the covariance between $Y_i$ and~$Y_j$, giving component variances along the diagonal of $\Sigma$.
